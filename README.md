# PhotoQuiz
You may know the game ”Geoguessr”, where you get to see a random image of Google Street View and you have to guess where you are. The closer your guess is to the real location, the more points you get. Our game has the same idea of guessing a location on a map. Only in our game everyone can upload a picture of a location and a hint. Other people can then guess where the picture is made. They can guess 3 times, every time they lose 20 points and when they ask for an hint they lose half the points.
