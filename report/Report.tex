\section{Introduction}
You may know the game "Geoguessr", where you get a random location of google streetview and you have to guess where you are, and the closer your guess is the more points you get. 
Our game has the same idea of guessing a location on a map. Only in our game everyone can upload a picture with a location and an hint. Other people can then guess where the picture is made. They can guess 3 times, every time they lose 20 points and when they ask for an hint they lose half the points.

\section{ the web application architecture}
For this application we chose to use the framework Sails.js. This is a  MVC framework for node.js. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Node.js, an execution environment for event-driven server-siede and networking application
\item front-end: For the front-end we chose to include Angular.js for this, because it is a very popular JavaScript framework, which extends HTML to make it more dynamic.
\item Database:  we chose MongoDB, this is a a very big noSQL database services. We chose to use it because it is flexible and is easy to use.
\end{itemize}

We chose Sails.js framework because it lets us write everything in the same language and takes over some tasks, for example it automatically sets up an API.
